# Hoppy Roo
A Doodle Jump-inspired game written in C++ using the Splashkit library. You play as Hoppy, a kangaroo who needs to climb his way to the top of the desert by hopping on a series of platforms. What lies at the top? Play and find out.

Game is currently in a non-functional state - player entity and physics have been created as well as the environment. High score-keeping is also functional.

Steps to complete:
* Procedurally generate platforms (this will be hard)
* Add main menu
* Add sound effects/music
* Add extra levels (optional)
